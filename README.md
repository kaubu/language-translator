# language-translator
Search through the definitions for many different languages, including ancient
languages.

## Note!!!
Rather than translating entire sentences, this looks up one word or phrase at
a time. Funtionality is planned in the future to search entire sentences,
split and tokenize them, then return the results.

## Usage
Simply run this to start:

```bash
python translator.py
```

## Credits
Credits to https://kaikki.org/, which supplied the majority of this codebase,
from the mining of Wiktionary to sorting it out. I only coded this program
which sorts through that data.
